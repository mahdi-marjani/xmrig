 - [#15](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/15) Added option `-l, --log-file=FILE` to write log to file.
 - [#15](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/15) Added option `-S, --syslog` to use syslog for logging, Linux only.
 - [#18](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/18) Added nice messages for accepted/rejected shares with diff and network latency.
 - [#20](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/20) Fixed `--cpu-affinity` for more than 32 threads.
 - Fixed Windows XP support.
 - Fixed regression, option `--no-color` was not fully disable colored output.
 - Show resolved pool IP address in miner output.
 
# v1.0.1
- Fix broken software AES implementation, app has crashed if CPU not support AES-NI, only version 1.0.0 affected.

# v1.0.0
- Miner complete rewritten in C++ with libuv.
- This version should be fully compatible (except config file) with previos versions, many new nice features will come in next versions.
- This is still beta. If you found regression, stability or perfomance issues or have an idea for new feature please fell free to open new [issue](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/new).
- Added new option `--print-time=N`, print hashrate report every N seconds.
- New hashrate reports, by default every 60 secons.
- Added Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 and 2017 support.
- Removed dependency on libcurl.
- To compile this version from source please switch to [dev](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/tree/dev) branch.

# v0.8.2

# v0.8.2
- Fixed L2 cache size detection for AMD CPUs (Bulldozer/Piledriver/Steamroller/Excavator architecture).
- Fixed gcc 7.1 support.

# v0.8.1
- Added nicehash support, detects automaticaly by pool URL, for example `cryptonight.eu.nicehash.com:3355` or manually via option `--nicehash`.

# v0.8.0
- Added double hash mode, also known as lower power mode. `--av=2` and `--av=4`.
- Added smart automatic CPU configuration. Default threads count now depends on size of the L3 cache of CPU.
- Added CryptoNight-Lite support for AEON `-a cryptonight-lite`.
- Added `--max-cpu-usage` option for auto CPU configuration mode.
- Added `--safe` option for adjust threads and algorithm variations to current CPU.
- No more manual steps to enable huge pages on Windows. XMRig will do it automatically.
- Removed BMI2 algorithm variation.
- Removed default pool URL.

# v0.6.0
- Added automatic cryptonight self test.
- New software AES algorithm variation. Will be automatically selected if cpu not support AES-NI.
